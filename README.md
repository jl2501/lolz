# lolz
dead simple automation for when you just can't even

Usage: lolz do that thing

Steps to make that work:
    create directory structure do/that/thing
    thing should be executable
    it gets executed
    done

If you're running a bunch of manual steps all the time and don't even have the time to start rethinking how to automate anything?
Just stick it in a bash script.
Or a python script.
Or Ruby, or perl or really anything executable at all.

But where do all these scripts go?
If you have a good answer to that, go do that.
Else, you can just stick them in a directory structure that describes their usage:
    lolz deploy that annoying microservice that requires like 5 steps before that someone always forgets at least one part of

will execute whatever is in deploy/that/annoying/microservice/that/requires/like/5/steps/before/that/someone/always/forgets/at/least/one/part/of
